# Script Creator Playbook  
ID: SCP-001  
Version: 1.5  
Status: Authoritative  
Applies To: ops-script-library  
Audience: Humans and AI systems (Melissa.ai)

## 1. Purpose

This playbook defines the mandatory process for creating operational scripts that are:

- Safe to automate
- Deterministic
- Auditable
- Human-reviewable
- Compatible with AI-assisted execution
- Suitable for shared internal libraries

Any script that does not fully comply with this playbook MUST NOT be published, automated, or reused.

## 2. Core Principles (Non-Negotiable)

All scripts MUST:

1. Be single-purpose  
2. Be non-interactive by default  
3. Fail fast with actionable errors  
4. Produce deterministic output  
5. Declare scope honestly (ReadOnly vs Write vs Destructive)  
6. Separate authoring, linting, and review  
7. Be safe for CI and unattended execution  
8. Make side effects explicit  
9. Support human-in-the-loop (HITL) when appropriate  
10. Prefer clarity over cleverness  

Violation of any principle is a defect.

## 3. Lifecycle Overview

Scripts progress through explicit, gated plays:

Mode A → Mode B → Mode C → Mode D  
Pre-Creation → Creation → Lint → Review

Optional post-approval plays:
- Packaging
- Orchestration
- AI augmentation

No play may be skipped.

## 4. Mode A — Pre-Creation Context Lock (MANDATORY)

### 4.1 Script Identity

Every script MUST define:

- **Package ID**  
  Format: `domain.script-name` (kebab-case, immutable)

- **Human Name**  
  Imperative verb phrase describing exactly what the script does

Example:
